# Low Level Programming Course
Welcome to my course on low level programming. You can go along with this course on my youtube channel, https://youtube.com/@lyammosnier. Each episode will have a video, and the transcript will be posted in this repo along with all the code used in the episode.

## Requirements
The course will be based on the Intel x86 instruction set, specifically for Linux. If you're on windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux to follow the course. If you're on a mac.... then use a virtual machine? Your mac is probably powerful enough for it anyway!

## Course syllabus
Here is the current plan for the course:
1. Hello world program
2. Input, Conditionals and Loops
3. Calculator program
4. Assembler output and the ELF headers
